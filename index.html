        <h2>Current music news</h2>
        <p>The Dutchman, who announced his retirement from the stage for a while, aims to be the secret artist who closes ULTRA. HARDWELL IS BACK!
            Yes, gentlemen, HARDWELL is back. After announcing that he was leaving the stage in 2018 and having gone through a pandemic, it seems the Dutchman is back to the delight of fans of electronic music and his in particular. Thus, Robbert van de Corput is expected to be in charge of closing the Main Stage of the ULTRA MUSIC FESTIVAL 2022. A festival that saw him grow since HARDWELL was present since he debuted in Miami in 2012 until he announced his withdrawal for a time.
            
            In fact, the organizers had been playing the mystery that the fans, since when they unveiled the final lineup, they announced that the closing on Sunday would be carried out by "one of the most iconic artists in the history of electronic music." From there the rumors began to spread through the network and two names were the main protagonists: Swedish House Mafia and HARDWELL. And, finally, it can be announced that HARDWELL is back.
            
            According to Billboard, the Dutchman returns to the stage with new music and what many asked for when he made his return to Tomorrowland: a new sound. Now HARDWELL is back and, according to the outlet, he does so with a revamped sound as "a departure, or evolution, from his previous commercially focused work." Bets are open to guess which sound HARDWELL has now leaned towards.
            
            But the news about the dj does not end there. And it is that not only do we have HARDWELL to return to the fore, but it is also possible that he does so with an album. In fact, it was Laidback Luke who commented that this new album would be amazing. Now we will be attentive to all those IDs that good old Robert will present, some in the Ultra streaming and, others more fortunate, live.</p>
